# Site Locator
Site Locator Project

This is my Site Locator Application for GEOG5990. My student ID is 200779106

How to use

In the current folder there are four folders, App, Doc Build, Documentation and Test_Files. 
The Doc Build folder contains all the files used to create the model's
documentation. The Documentation folder contains the html files for the documentation.
The App folder includes just the files needed for the application. The Test_Files contains 
the scripts and .txt files used for testing the App.

To run the App you can run the "SiteLocator.py" file from the terminal or an IDE such as 
SPyder. When run a window will appear with two tabs, "Simple" and "Advanced". The Simple tab
can be used to create a merged output where the rasters which are set to one will be evenly 
weighted. The Advanced tab, allows the user to input custom weightings for each of the input 
rasters.

If you would like some more information on how the app works, the
documentation is available at http://dialogplus.leeds.ac.uk/geog5870/web44/prog/docs/index.html" 
(Connection to Leeds University Network Required) or alternatively you can open the webpages 
locally through the documentation folder.
