    <h3>Portfolio</h3>

    <div>
        <p>
            This is the area for my portfolio submission. The submission entails an Agent Based Model 
            (ABM). The ABM code is written in Python and when run displays some agents who 
            move, eat, reproduce (asexually, similar to bacteria) and die.
        </p> 
            
        <p>
            The model is in the file "model.py". The starting coordinates are taken from a
            <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/practicals/python/agent-framework/part9/data.html">
            website</a> as requested in the practical notes. The movement of the agents is in a random 
            direction, or they stay still. When they eat, a set amount is subtracted from the environment 
            and added to the agents store. Reproduction and death occur with varying degrees of 
            probability depending on age and store value of the agent.
        </p>

        <p>
            The environment is a raster and in a file called "in.txt". It is read into the model 
            through the module called "enviro.py". There is also a class used to store all the agents'
            data and methods in a module called "agentframework.py".
