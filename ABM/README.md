 Agent based modelling for programming course

 This is my Agent Based Model for GEOG5990. My student ID is 200779106

 How to use

 To use the agent based model open up the "model.py" file in a puthon IDE
 (I recommend Spyder). When you run the model, two windows will pop up,
 and on one of them it will have a drop down menu called "Model". Click
 on the model then click "Run" and you will see the model animation begin
 to run. You can close the windows and stop the model if it hasn't already.
 Feel free to change some of the initial parameters if you wuld like to
 experiment.

 If you would like some more information on how the model works, there is
 some documentation available on my webiste https://ee13zackhan.github.io/
